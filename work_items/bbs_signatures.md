# BBS Signatures

BBS Signatures are a form of short group digital signature that supports multi-message signing with selective reveal on proof derivation. These properties are advantageous within a variety of applications however most notably within attribute based credential technologies such as Verifiable Credentials.

This work items focus is to formally document the cryptographic representation of and process of producing a BBS signature along side associated structures such as derived proofs of knowledge of a BBS signature.

As a proposed starting point for the work item, the following document is offered (https://github.com/mattrglobal/bbs-signatures-spec).

## Work Item Owners
- Tobias Looker (@tplooker, tobias.looker@mattr.global)
- Mike Lodder (@mikelodder7, mike@cryptid.tech)
- Andrew Whitehead (@andrewwhitehead, cywolf@gmail.com)

## Outcome

The overall intent from this work item is to produce a document that can be proposed as an input to the IETF CFRG for formal standardization of BBS Signatures.

## Deliverables
- A document that formally defines the cryptographic representation of and process of producing a BBS signature along side associated structures such as derived proofs of knowledge of a BBS signature.
- A set of test fixtures to support the development of interoperable implementations.
- Estimated six month timeline

## Meetings
- A weekly work item call with a primary focus on issue review and general evolution of the BBS signature document.
